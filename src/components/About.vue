    <h1>About FinSplit</h1>
    <p>
      FinSplit is a smart expense-sharing application developed to simplify group expense tracking.
      Whether you're splitting a dinner bill with friends, planning a trip, or managing shared household expenses,
      FinSplit makes it easy to track who owes what, avoid awkward money conversations, and settle up efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was developed out of a common frustration: managing shared expenses in college, trips, and everyday life.
      FinSplit ensures transparency, reduces manual calculations, and provides a clean UI for managing contributions.
